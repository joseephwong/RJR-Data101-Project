    "I got my data from kaggle.com on a dataset labelled \"Student Mental Health Survey: Online Survey on the Mental Health of IT Student\" by Abdullah Ashfaq. A free account on Kaggle is required to download the dataset, but is publically viewable online. It was last updated 3 months ago. The data was gathered through an online survey and responses where anonymized to keep confidentiality. A possible ethical concern is that only IT students were given the opportunity to take the survey, meaning many groups, such as college students with other majors, are unrepresented by the dataset. The data explores the students' demographic data (while keeping their anonymity), lifestyle, experiences, university campus, self-reported mental health levels, and coping mechanisms.\n",

    "-Educational attainment refers to the highest level of education completed by a person, shown as a percentage of all persons in that age group. Below upper secondary education includes early childhood education, primary education or lower secondary education. Programmes at the lower secondary education level are designed to lay the foundation across a wide range of subjects. Programmes at the upper secondary level are more specialised and offer students more choices and diverse pathways for completing their secondary education. Tertiary education includes short-cycle tertiary education, bachelor’s, master’s, or doctoral or equivalent levels.\n",

Considering this information, we can infer that as the parental level of education of each students rises, the student has a higher chance of recieving a higher overall score on their exam"
